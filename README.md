# pilot

Unified AI coding conductor for Claude Code. Auto-routes the user's intent
to the right underlying skill (grill → plan → TDD → debug → verify → ship),
enforces a configurable set of CLAUDE.md quality gates via shell hooks, and
stays extensible through a one-line registry edit.

- **Repository structure:** Claude Code single-plugin marketplace
  (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` + `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` at root).
- **Skill source:** `skills/pilot/` — `SKILL.md` (routing playbook) + `registry.md` (single-source-of-truth phase table) + `guardrails.md` (CLAUDE.md → hook mapping) + `playbooks/`.
- **Hooks:** `hooks/{plan-gate,pre-commit,verify-gate,sessionstart-banner,precompact-anchor,log-skill-invocation}.sh` — wired across PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop, SubagentStop, SessionStart, PreCompact.
- **MCPs (bundled):** `context7` (docs) · `playwright` (UI verify) · `github` (review / ship).
- **Bundled skills (this plugin's own):** `migration-safety`, `pre-deploy-checklist`, `post-deploy-monitor` (all under `skills/`). Currently scaffolds — see `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-20-production-hardening.md` for completion queue.
- **Slash commands:** `commands/pilot-{status,off,off-rails,back-on,bypass,doctor,trace}.md`.

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) for what shipped in each version and
[`prereqs.md`](./prereqs.md) for what plugins/skills pilot prefers to route
into.

## Quick install (marketplace path — recommended)

> **Before publishing:** replace `bhargavch19` below with your actual
> GitHub handle. Run `bash dev/finalize-readme.sh` to substitute it
> automatically (uses `gh api user` if you're authed, or pass it as an
> argument: `bash dev/finalize-readme.sh <handle>`). The repo must be
> pushed to a public (or accessible) GitHub URL — pilot is a
> single-plugin marketplace, so the repo IS the marketplace.

In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add bhargavch19/pilot
/plugin install pilot@pilot
```

Restart Claude Code. All five hook events (PreToolUse on Edit/Write/
MultiEdit/NotebookEdit + Bash, Stop, SubagentStop, SessionStart, PreCompact)
wire automatically via the plugin manifest. The slash commands become
available, the SessionStart banner shows the active version + a first-run
hint pointing at `/pilot-doctor`, and the bundled MCP servers start in the
background for on-demand tools.

**Bundled MCP servers** (all pinned, all start automatically):

| Server | Pinned version | First-run cost | Used in phases |
|---|---|---|---|
| `context7` | `@2.2.5` | ~3MB npx fetch | Docs lookup (any) |
| `playwright` | `@0.0.75` | ~3MB npx + ~300MB Chromium on first navigate | Verify (UI) |
| `github` | `@2025.4.8` | ~10MB npx fetch | Review · Ship |

**API keys + opt-outs** — export in your shell before launching Claude Code:

```bash
export CONTEXT7_API_KEY="…"      # optional — raises context7 rate limits
export GITHUB_TOKEN="…"          # required for any github MCP write op

# Per-server opt-outs (set to 1 to skip that MCP's routing):
export PILOT_DISABLE_CONTEXT7=1
export PILOT_DISABLE_PLAYWRIGHT=1
export PILOT_DISABLE_GITHUB=1
```

Run `/pilot-doctor` after install to confirm all three MCP commands are
on PATH and to see which env vars are set.

Verify with `/pilot-doctor` in any session.

## Dev install (one command — symlink + live edit)

For hacking on pilot without going through marketplace publishing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhargavch19/pilot ~/Workspace/claude-skill
bash ~/Workspace/claude-skill/dev/symlink-pilot.sh    # does all 3 steps
# restart Claude Code, then run /pilot-doctor
```

`symlink-pilot.sh` chains three idempotent steps:

1. **Symlink** `skills/pilot` → `~/.claude/skills/pilot` (live edits show up immediately).
2. **Wire hooks** — `wire-hooks.sh` merges pilot's 6 hook entries into `~/.claude/settings.json` via `jq` (auto-backed up to `settings.json.bak.<ts>`).
3. **Register MCPs** — `wire-mcps.sh` reads `mcpServers` from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and registers `context7` / `playwright` / `github` via `claude mcp add` (skips entries that already exist).

Each step is also runnable atomically (`bash dev/wire-hooks.sh`, `bash dev/wire-mcps.sh`). Use `SKIP_WIRE=1 bash dev/symlink-pilot.sh` to refresh only the symlink without re-running the wiring.

To remove:

```bash
bash ~/Workspace/claude-skill/dev/unwire-hooks.sh      # idempotent
bash ~/Workspace/claude-skill/dev/unwire-mcps.sh       # idempotent
rm ~/.claude/skills/pilot                              # only if you symlinked
```

## What pilot does

1. **Literal-name shortcut.** If your prompt literally names a skill or MCP (`context7`, `playwright`, `tdd`, `frontend-design`, `improve-codebase-architecture`, etc.), pilot routes there immediately — skipping keyword-based phase detection. Multi-mention prompts produce a sequenced phase chain. See "How to invoke pilot" below.
2. **Phase routing.** When no literal name is present, pilot reads `skills/pilot/registry.md`, scans the user message for trigger keywords, inspects project state (`.planning/`, `git status`, `git log`), and invokes the right underlying skill via the Skill tool.
3. **Quality gates.** Six hooks enforce CLAUDE.md-aligned rules — see `skills/pilot/guardrails.md` for the full mapping.
4. **Bundled MCPs.** `context7` (docs lookup), `playwright` (UI verify), and `github` (review / ship) start automatically and are surfaced to the Skill tool as `mcp__<name>__*` tools.
5. **Stay extensible.** Adding a new skill is a one-line append to `registry.md`. Adding a new guardrail is a hook script plus a test under `tests/hooks/`.

## How to invoke pilot

Three invocation tiers, in order of explicit-ness:

### Tier 1 — just describe the work

Pilot's `description` frontmatter contains trigger keywords that Claude Code auto-matches: **build, fix, ship, explore, messy, broken, review**. A normal work prompt is enough — pilot auto-engages on session start and infers the phase from your prompt + project state.

```
build a scientific-mode toggle for the calc app
```

### Tier 2 — name your tools explicitly (recommended)

If your prompt literally contains a skill id or MCP name, pilot pre-resolves every named token to a phase on parse — no keyword scoring, no ambiguity. This is the most reliable invocation pattern.

```
Build feature X.
Use context7 to confirm the library docs.
Plan via writing-plans, then TDD it.
Verify with playwright. Screenshot the result.
Finally run improve-codebase-architecture.
```

→ pilot resolves to:

| Prompt token | Routes to |
|---|---|
| `context7` | `context7` MCP |
| `writing-plans` | `superpowers:writing-plans` |
| `TDD` | `tdd` |
| `playwright` | `playwright` MCP |
| `improve-codebase-architecture` | that skill |

Five-phase chain, no clarifying questions.

**Match rules:**
- Multi-word skill names must appear as one hyphenated token (`improve-codebase-architecture`, not "improve codebase architecture").
- Namespace prefixes are optional — `frontend-design` resolves to `frontend-design:frontend-design`; `writing-plans` to `superpowers:writing-plans`.
- Case-insensitive (`TDD`, `tdd`, `Tdd` all match).
- Generic vocabulary doesn't count: "design the UI" does not match `frontend-design` because the literal hyphenated token is absent.

### Tier 3 — force-prefix with `pilot:`

When the work has no obvious trigger keywords but you still want pilot to engage:

```
pilot: think through whether to extract this into a separate package
```

The literal `pilot:` prefix overrides phase ambiguity and pushes pilot to route even on exploratory prompts.

## Production phases (v0.7+)

Beyond the core Frame → Plan → Build → Verify → Review → Ship → Capture cycle, pilot routes 7 production-oriented phases at decimal slots:

| Slot | Phase | Primary skill | Fires when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.5 | Triage | `triage` | "what to work on", incoming bugs, PR queue |
| 0.75 | Bootstrap | `init` | repo has no CLAUDE.md |
| 4.5 | Performance | `diagnose` | "slow", "latency", "profile", "regression" |
| 6.5 | Security | `security-review` | "audit", "OWASP", diff touches auth/crypto/network |
| 7.5 | Migration | `migration-safety`* | diff touches `migrations/` or lockfile |
| 7.75 | Pre-deploy | `pre-deploy-checklist`* | immediately before Ship on a release branch |
| 8.5 | Post-deploy | `post-deploy-monitor`* | after Ship completes |

`*` Scaffold — registers and redirects to a working fallback. Full content in queue (see `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-20-production-hardening.md`).

Each phase appears as a row in `skills/pilot/registry.md` with its triggers and fallbacks. Phase ordering is enforced by the **Resolution rule** column — e.g., `7.5 Migration` is required before `7.75 Pre-deploy` if migrations/lockfile changed.

## Bypass

| When you want to… | Use |
|---|---|
| Skip the next gate fire | `/pilot-off` |
| Skip only plan-gate | `/pilot-bypass --no-plan` |
| Turn pilot off for the session | `/pilot-off-rails` |
| Turn pilot back on | `/pilot-back-on` |
| Diagnose what's wired and what isn't | `/pilot-doctor` |
| Quick wired-hooks view | `/pilot-status` |
| Inspect current session's routing chain | `/pilot-trace` |

Bypass also works via free-text phrases in the user message (`pilot off`,
`pilot off rails`, `pilot --no-plan`) — handy when typing in a deep
sub-conversation.

## Known limitations

Honest list of edges that bite — surfaced via cross-setup audit, not theoretical.

| Area | Limitation | Workaround / status |
|---|---|---|
| **Platform** | All hooks are bash. Windows PowerShell users can't run them natively. | Use WSL or Git Bash; full PowerShell port queued. |
| **macOS cache** | Hooks write to `~/.cache/pilot/` (XDG convention), not `~/Library/Caches/` (macOS convention). | Set `XDG_CACHE_HOME=~/Library/Caches` in your shell if you want native macOS location. |
| **Web app** | Claude Code's web surface (claude.ai/code) doesn't fire local hooks. | Hooks only enforce in CLI/desktop sessions. Skill-level routing still works (model-driven). |
| **Pre-commit on amend** | The `pre-commit.sh` hook only inspects the current `-m`/`--message`. Interactive-rebase amends of mid-history commits bypass the conventional-commit check. | Run `bash tests/run.sh` locally before pushing if your branch contains amended-via-rebase commits. |
| **Plan-gate freshness** | Plan-existence check is permissive: ANY plan file matching `docs/superpowers/plans/*.md` OR `.planning/*/PLAN.md` satisfies the gate, even if the plan is 6+ months old. | Treat as a soft guard, not a contract. Use `/pilot-bypass --no-plan` if a stale plan is blocking a small unrelated edit. |
| **PreCompact token cost** | Re-anchor injection consumes ~10 lines post-compact. Linear in the number of phases in the registry. | Mitigated in v0.7.1 — registry list collapsed to a pointer ("17 phases, see registry.md"). Token cost ~constant as registry grows. |
| **Concurrent sessions** | Pre-v0.7.1, `routing.log` interleaved entries from concurrent Claude Code sessions. | v0.7.1 added a `session=<8char>` field per entry; `/pilot-trace` scopes to the current session_id. Older entries fall back to last `skill=pilot` boundary. |
| **Built-in skill detection** | `/pilot-doctor` can't file-probe Claude Code built-in skills (`init`, `verify`, `run`, `simplify`, `review`, `security-review`). They're loaded by the Claude Code binary, not stored on disk. | Doctor marks them as `• built-in — file probe N/A` instead of `✗`. |
| **Wire-hooks dedup** | `wire-hooks.sh` dedups pilot entries by hook-script basename, not by absolute path. Two pilot installs in different repos would collide. | Don't run two pilot installs concurrently. Use `bash dev/unwire-hooks.sh` before switching install paths. |

Each limitation surfaces in `/pilot-doctor` when it matters.

## Configuration

Per-repo runner extensions for `verify-gate.sh` via `.pilot.json` at the
repo root:

```json
{ "test_patterns": ["rake test", "my-custom-runner"] }
```

The patterns are regex strings; they're unioned with pilot's built-in
runner list (pytest, bun test, vitest, nx test, make test, ...).

## Tests

```bash
bash tests/run.sh    # unit-style fixture tests for every hook
bash dev/dry-run.sh  # end-to-end simulation with realistic Claude Code JSON
```

Plain bash + jq; no extra deps. CI runs both on ubuntu-latest and
macos-latest plus shellcheck on `hooks/` and `dev/`.
